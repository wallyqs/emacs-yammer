h1. README


Fork from psanford/emacs-yammer in order to update changes
to the yammer web service and stop using hmac-sha1 as it was not 
working anymore.

h2. To install

git clone git://github.com/invertedplate/emacs-yammer.git
;; Add emacs-yammer to your loadpath

;; Set up the consumer-key and consumer-secret, introduce them 
on yammer.el

Finally on your .emacs:  
(require 'yammer)
(yammer-authenticate "linux username")


This will create a file ~/.yammer-token that is used later for the requests.
